## Helper functions for the book "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python"

This is the ``mglearn`` package used in the book, which you can also find in the
[accompanying repository](
https://github.com/amueller/introduction_to_ml_with_python)

You don't need this repo, all the code is there:

    https://github.com/amueller/introduction_to_ml_with_python

This repository is a stand-alone package in case you really feel like you want to
install mglearn into your Python environment, for some reason or another. You can install it simply with

    pip install mglearn

In particular, installing this package is a very easy way to add it to your Python search path.
Or you can just check out the notebooks from the repository above, and add the path to the
mglearn subfolder to your PYTHONPATH environment variable (or set it in your IDE).
